## Concurrent Model Checker

The default MPS model checker runs all checker sequentially 
and during execution the MPS UI is blocked.

This plugin addresses those drawbacks and accelerates the checking procedure by running checker concurrently 
in background threads so that MPS is not blocked in meantime.
